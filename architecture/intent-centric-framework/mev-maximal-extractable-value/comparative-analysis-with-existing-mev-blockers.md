# Comparative Analysis with Existing MEV Blockers

This comprehensive, research-driven methodology offers a more robust mitigation of Miner Extractable Value (MEV) than standalone solutions.

### Key Features of the Approach

* **Formal Verification**: Through the application of formal verification techniques, we meticulously ensure that the intended execution semantics are preserved. This significantly reduces the risk of unwanted behaviors being leveraged for MEV extraction, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of transaction execution.
* **Final-State Resolution**: The architecture incorporates resolvers that align the execution plan with the current blockchain state. This essential step helps eliminate potential discrepancies that could otherwise be exploited by attackers, thereby safeguarding the integrity of our operations.
* **Integrated Real-Time Data Feeds**: Our dedicated searchers work continuously to update and optimize decision-making processes in real-time. This ensures that execution plans remain agile and responsive to rapid market changes, thereby maintaining efficiency and effectiveness under varying conditions.
* **Holistic Intent Aggregation**: We aggregate user intents across a spectrum of on-chain operations—trading, vault operation, yield farming management. This approach inherently disperses individual actions, making them less predictable and, therefore, more secure from potential exploitation.

### Distinctive Approaches in the Industry

* **Flashbots and Similar Solutions:** Flashbots provide an off-chain auction mechanism that allows miners to extract MEV in a controlled manner, thereby reducing its negative impact on users. However, these solutions often rely on external coordination and still expose some level of MEV risk to end users.
* **CoW Mev Blocker**: CoW Protocol employs a model based on “Coincidence of Wants,” effectively minimizing order exposure by matching orders accordingly. This approach proves highly efficient within the context of trade execution, mainly focusing on providing front-running protection in a trade-matching environment.
* **Our approach:** We batch user intents for trading, vault operation, yield farming across liquidity fragmentation, which inherently obfuscates individual actions.With dedicated searchers, our system continuously updates optimization decisions, ensuring that execution plans remain adaptive to rapid market changes.The resolvers in our architecture ensure that the execution plan is reconciled with the current blockchain state, preventing any discrepancies that attackers might exploit.

In summary, our system offers a comprehensive suite of features and methodologies aimed at robustly addressing the challenges presented by MEV, contributing to a more secure and efficient on-chain ecosystem. By integrating these innovative solutions, we ensure that the system remains ahead of potential threats, continually safeguarding user transactions through cutting-edge technology.
