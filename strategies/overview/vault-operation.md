# Vault Operation

TETRICS Protocol enables asset managers to create and manage automated vaults for yield generation. These vaults operate via intent‑centric approach that abstracts complex on‑chain operations. Users simply declare their intent to deposit funds, while asset managers define the vault’s strategy. The system then optimizes, aggregates, and executes these actions atomically, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and security.

### **Vault Deployment Process**

1. **Vault Creation & Strategy Declaration:**
   * An asset manager initiates the creation of a yield optimization vault by declaring a high-level intent: "_Publish a yield optimization vault for Asset X, with a 0.5% management fee and automated rebalancing if allocations deviate by over 5%._"
2. **Smart Contract Deployment:**
   * A vault smart contract is deployed using a standardized vault factory. This contract acts as the blueprint for the vault, signed according to EIP-7521, and includes:
     * Governance rules for future strategy adjustments.
     * Risk parameters.
     * Operational logic.
3. **Strategy Documentation:**
   * The asset manager provides a comprehensive strategy document covering:
     * Governance documentation.
     * Historical yield data.
     * Performance benchmarks.
4. **Marketplace Listing:**
   * Once deployed, the vault is published on TETRICS's decentralized marketplace. Key aspects include:
     * **Vault Discovery:** Vault details such as asset type, strategy, fee model, and risk profile are made discoverable and indexed onchain.
     * **Metadata Registration:** Functions for deposit, withdrawal, and rebalancing, as well as fee structures and governance parameters, are registered.

This process ensures that potential depositors can view and assess the available vaults effectively in the marketplace.

### User Deposit Process

1. **User Interaction & Deposit Intent**
   * **Connecting Wallet:** Users access the vault via the TETRICS Protocol UI. Once the wallet is connected, users can navigate to the desired vault page.
   * **Deposit Declaration:** Users submit a deposit intent, such as "Deposit 10 ETH into Vault X for yield farming," adhering to the EIP‑7521 standard.
2. **Batch Aggregation & Atomic Deposit**
   * **Intent Grouping:** Deposit intents from multiple users are aggregated into batches for efficiency.
   * **Solver Optimization:** The solver module analyzes deposits, ensuring they meet vault requirements (e.g., minimum deposit thresholds) while optimizing for cost-effective execution.
   * **Execution Engine:** Batched intents are compiled into one atomic transaction to optimize gas usage and reduce costs.
3. **Confirmation & Token Minting**

* **Transaction Confirmation:** Once an on-chain confirmation is achieved, the vault updates its internal ledger.
* **Token Minting:** Vault tokens are minted and allocated based on each depositor's share.
* **Fund Transfer:** Deposited funds are moved from the user's wallet to the vault contract.

### Asset Manager

### **Vault Performance Overview**

Detailed dashboards offer users real-time performance metrics, historical data, and governance updates, akin to existing solutions like Yearn.

* **User Dashboards**\
  Detailed dashboards provide users with real-time performance metrics, historical data, and governance updates—paralleling existing vault solutions like Yearn.
* **Onchain Audit Trail**\
  Every deposit, withdrawal, and rebalancing event is recorded on-chain for transparency.
* **Transparency & Reporting**\
  Asset managers can propose governance changes, such as fee adjustments or strategy shifts, via on-chain mechanisms. Successful proposals are automatically executed, updating the vault’s parameters.
* **Governance Proposals**\
  Profits from yield strategies are periodically distributed to vault token holders or reinvested through atomic on-chain transactions.

### **Earnings Allocation**

* **Profit Distribution & Governance**\
  The Execution Engine consolidates rebalancing actions into a single transaction, ensuring asset shifts occur simultaneously to preserve balance and minimize slippage.
* **Atomic Rebalancing**\
  The adapter retrieves data and executes swaps to optimize yield, potentially shifting funds between staking pools and lending protocols based on real-time data.

### **External Protocol Integration**

* **Automated Strategy Execution**\
  Rebalancing intentions are processed with deposit and withdrawal actions. The asset manager configures periodic rebalancing, such as, "Rebalance vault if asset allocation deviates
