# Yield Farming Management

TETRICS Protocol enables yield farming to declaratively specify their yield optimization strategies across multiple protocols. This approach abstracts the complexities of interacting with various yield platforms, allowing users to focus on their desired outcomes. By leveraging batch aggregation, solver optimization, and a robust adapter framework, TETRICS transforms high-level yield farming intents into atomic, on‑chain transactions.

### Yield Farming Optimization

* **Efficiency & Privacy**\
  Multiple users' yield farming intents, such as Bob's, are combined into batch operations.
* **Batch Aggregation**\
  Strategies can adjust dynamically without manual intervention. Example rule: "Switch to Pool B if Pool A’s yield drops below 10%."
* **Conditional Adjustments**\
  Define further conditions, like: "Allocate 50 ETH for yield generation if the annual yield exceeds 12% across Pools A, B, and C."
* **Reduced Gas Fees**\
  Aggregation optimizes collective execution of yield farming strategies while preserving individual strategy confidentiality, thus reducing gas fees.
* **EIP-7521 Compliance**\
  Ensures intents are structured, secure, and interoperable.

### Adapter Integration

The platform utilizes standardized API interfaces to ensure seamless interactions. This system can fetch yield data, execute liquidity swaps, and manage fund transfers across various protocols.

1. **Uniform API Calls**\
   The Adapter Framework connects with diverse yield platforms, AMMs, and lending protocols to efficiently execute farming strategy.
2. **Protocol Connectivity**\
   Advanced optimization algorithms assess potential allocations to ensure maximum yield, minimizing both transaction costs and latency.
3. **Algorithmic Decision-Making**\
   Solvers retrieve real-time yield data from external oracles and liquidity pools to evaluate the performance of Pools A, B, and C.
4. **External Data Integration**\
   The solver module analyzes batched intents and leverages available liquidity and yield metrics to determine the optimal allocation strategy.
5. **Intra‑Batch Matching**\
   Solver optimization is executed to enhance overall system efficiency and yield outcomes.

### Execution Engine & On‑Chain Transaction

This section outlines the execution process within our yield optimization system, highlighting atomic transactions and on-chain settlements.

1. **Atomic Transaction Assembly**
   * The Execution Engine compiles an optimized yield farming strategy into a single transaction, ensuring atomicity.
   * The transaction includes:
     * Depositing funds into selected yield pools.
     * Transferring funds between pools based on strategic conditions.
     * Executing reinvestment or profit-taking functions.
2. **Composite Transaction Construction**
   * This includes all necessary operations to optimize yield farming.
3. **On-Chain Settlement**
   * The execution results are recorded on-chain.
   * The atomic transaction is submitted to the blockchain, where smart contracts handle deposits, fund transfers, and rebalancing actions.
   * The entire operation executes as a single transaction, reverting all operations if any step fails, thus safeguarding users from partial execution risks.
4. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   * Updated yield data from the execution process is pushed to user dashboards, providing continuous, real-time monitoring.
