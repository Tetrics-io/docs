### What Tetrics Does

#### _**Hyperliquid Liquidity × DeFi  Liquidity across chains**_

In DeFi, new yield assets continuously appear across many chains. However, traders cannot use them as collateral for trading perps on Hyperliquid — which leads to missed huge opportunities, this is where Tetrics comes in.

If you’re using Builder Code or operating a HIP-3 exchange, Tetrics unlocks:

* _Collateralize a wide range of yield assets across chains_
* _Seamless unified-margin trading experience_
* _One integration — minimal development effort_

Build different with Tetrics.
