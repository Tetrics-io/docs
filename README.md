# Welcome

### Our Vision

Imagine a platform where you can compose any strategy across all crypto markets—on-chain, cross-chain, and off-chain—with unparalleled capital efficiency. Our vision is to empower users to define high-level, outcome-driven intents that abstract the underlying execution complexities. Whether you’re deploying advanced yield farming, creating intricate vault strategies, or orchestrating cross-chain liquidity moves, our system seamlessly integrates multiple protocols and data sources. Leveraging cutting-edge optimization algorithms, modular plugins, and formal verification techniques, our platform transforms these complex strategies into single, atomic transactions, ensuring maximum performance, security, and optimal capital utilization. This unified framework redefines decentralized finance by making sophisticated, multi-market strategies accessible and efficient for all users.

### Before TETRICS <a href="#problem-statement" id="problem-statement"></a>

**Liquidity is fragmented across many blockchains / CEXs.**

Strategies across this fragmentation lead to find better profit opportunities, but will face higher execution costs and more complex risk exposure.
